## Functionality
- **Sign in to your Kanban board**: to access and manage your boards, or register with a unique username and password to access the platform
- **Manage boards**: Create, edit, delete, and share as many boards as you want. Rename your boards (by hovering over the board name and cliking on the three-dot options button that shows), or leave a board you don't need anymore (also through the options menu). Each user automatically gets a personal board that can't be deleted or left.
- **Manage tasks**: Add tasks to your boards, and move them around in your board to keep track of your progress. Use either the buttons or drag and drop to move tasks around. Delete finished tasks to keep your board clean and organized.
- **Collaboration**: Invite other users on the platform to your boards, and also be invited to other users' boards. Manage your boards and tasks together with your collaborators. 
- **Administration**: Have full and exclusive control over boards that you have created (including your Personal Board). Delete boards, rename boards, add collaborators and remove collaborators from your boards.
- **Responsiveness**: The Kanban board's design is fully responsive, and works on all devices. Log in to your account from your phone or PC and manage your boards on the go, without losing any functionality or user experience.
